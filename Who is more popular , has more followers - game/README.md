# Which person is more popular/has more followers ? - game

Which person is more popular? Who has more followers (As of 2019)? Guess right.

## Description

There will be two famous personalities competing against each other (e.g. BeyonceÃÅ vs LeBron James). You have to guess which personality has the most followers

You get a point for each correct answer.

It is game over if you guess incorrect.

## Changelog

Dec 30th 2022

- I added a failsafe - if the user types in a letter instead of a number
- I added a failsafe - if the random personality is competing against them self, the code will select a new opponent.
- I added a feature that allows the user to display the number of followers on the screen itself, thus circumventing the game and being able to correctly guess each time. It is more akin to a debug functionality.
